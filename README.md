# Project Name
Boston Transportation Systems 

# Mission Statement
To provide a comprehensive, efficient, and sustainable transportation network for the city of Boston, ensuring safe, accessible, and timely transit for all residents and visitors. Our goal is to connect every corner of our city through state-of-the-art transportation systems, enhancing the quality of life, supporting economic growth, and promoting environmental responsibility.

The Boston Transportation generates vast amounts of data daily regarding transit operations and user activities. An effective system is essential to organize and manage this data. Should issues arise, the database aids in identifying their origins. It should allow data segmentation, such as viewing ridership variations by transit type, station, or line. This database is a valuable tool for the Boston Transportation, offering insights for operational enhancement, like visualizing ridership trends on maps. Additionally, it bolsters the MBTA's security by addressing faulty devices and granting role-specific data access.

The project for the Boston Transportation System database management system focuses on creating a unified database to house details associated with Boston Transportation functions, encompassing aspects like routes, ticketing, finances, and daily operations. The initiative aims to centralize all pertinent data, enhancing MBTA's operational precision and efficiency.

This platform offers features such as purchasing and refilling tickets, passes, and Charlie cards. Users can also view card statuses, expiration dates, station information for transits, and transaction details, including timestamps and amounts. Furthermore, the system provides real-time updates on operational status of lines and stations, flagging those affected by construction or other disruptions. This not only facilitates smoother commutes for passengers but also aids in addressing business challenges and compiling reports.

# Objectives
1. The goal is to create a relational database tailored for secure and efficient handling of MBTA data, encompassing aspects like stations, cards, tickets, top-ups, check-ins, and routes.
2. This database should support daily operation tracking, offer insights into business trends over specific durations, and highlight opportunities for Boston Transportation system enhancements.
3. The platform must facilitate travel through multiple recharge methods, such as Ride credits, Pass purchases, and Wallet refills.
4. It's crucial for the system to identify and nullify unauthorized transactions, especially those stemming from third-party breaches, by recognizing the device used during the recharging process.
